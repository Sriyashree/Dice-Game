# Dice-Game

Here, I have attempted to create a dice game with 2 dices visible on screen, wherein upon refreshing the HTML page, the values displayed on the dice changes in a random manner.

Here, HTML has been used to create the basic structure of the webpage, and CSS has been used to style the HTML elements. JavaScript has been used to dynamically render parts of the website, like the randomly changing dice images, the heading that declares the winner, etc. 

This project is from Udemy's The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp course by Dr. Angela Yu. The HTML and CSS files are from the course, while the JavaScript portion is entirely my own work.
